# HelloFresh Case Study
Data science case study: Churn Prediction using real-world HelloFresh data. The project has been carried out in 4 days (time allotted for the challenge).

# Prerequisites
I used Conda 4.5.11 with Python 3.6.5 on a machine implementing Windows 10 64-bit to set up my PyData stack. I worked within a new environment defined and activated via terminal as in the following:
> conda create --name hellofresh python=3.6.5 numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn py-xgboost

> conda activate hellofresh

The "main.py" script executes the whole workflow and saves the output in a logfile.
> cd \<path of this folder\>

> python main.py
