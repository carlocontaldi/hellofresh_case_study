# HelloFresh Case Study
Data science case study: Churn Prediction using real-world HelloFresh data.

The report offers an in-depth description of my work and thought process. The project has been carried out in 4 days (time allotted for the challenge).

# Prerequisites
I used Conda 4.5.11 with Python 3.6.5 on a machine implementing Windows 10 64-bit to set up my PyData stack. I worked within a new environment defined and activated via terminal as in the following:
> conda create --name hellofresh python=3.6.5 numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn py-xgboost

> conda activate hellofresh

The data used in this case study can be found @https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/140jRpRUOGCWDLtg1q1GtEz53JINi4aUE?usp=sharing. If you would like to reproduce my results download the data files, store them in a "data" folder and run the main script.

The "main.py" script executes the whole workflow and saves the output in a logfile.
> python main.py
